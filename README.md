# Lyrics Bites

Learn your favourite songs one bite at a time!

## The inspiration

My girlfriend always told me ..."David if you really want to improve your English you'd better learn the song lyrics, <br/>
that's the best way to become fluent."<br />

Great!!! But every time I tried I always stopped after memorizing the first couple of verses<br/>
I thought, why not build up a web application where I can finally receive via e-mail one verse per day?<br/>

### Goals

Build a MERN application (Mongodb, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
My first application with a frontend and backend and all the possible issues that a full-stack dev has to face with.

### Description 

The idea is to query two API to retrieve the song lyrics and then give the possibility to the user to chunk the song<br/>
and set it to receive one verse every day in his email address.<br/>

Due to the free MusixMatch API account, where you can get access only to 30% of their API, I used for the Album's cover LastFm API.
